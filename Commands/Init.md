# git init
The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.
If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mddir NewDirectory
cd NewDiorectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[staus](./Status.md), 
[add](./Add/.md), 
[commit](./Commit), 
[push](,/Push.md) and more.
Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapuslate all content, including other directories.
